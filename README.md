GameBoy Classic Emulator in Python
==================================

This is my attempt to make a fully working Gameboy emulator from scratch,
without looking at any other implementation.

Status
======

This is *not yet* a working version.

I'm just pushing to this repo as the project proceeds. See the file
[PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) for a few notes.

Usage
=====

To insert a cartridge and start the emulator:

    $ python gameboy cartridge.gb

To disassemble a file:

    $ python gameboy --start-address=0x00 --disassemble=gameboy/roms/boot
