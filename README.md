GameBoy Classic Emulator in Python
==================================

This is my attempt to make a fully working Gameboy emulator from scratch,
without looking at any other implementation.

Status
======

This is *not yet* a working version.

I'm just pushing to this repo as the project proceeds. See the [progress
log](progress/README.md) for a few notes.

Usage
=====

To insert a cartridge and start the emulator:

    $ python gameboy cartridge.gb

To disassemble a file:

    $ python gameboy --start-address=0x00 --disassemble=gameboy/roms/boot

Supported Python versions
=========================

Python 2.7, 3.x and pypy with PySDL2 and numpy.

To use with pypy, install PySDL2 and a version of numpy that works:

    $ pypy -m pip install PySDL2
    $ pypy -m pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/pypy/numpy.git

This works for me, but pypy doesn't really speed anything up that much at the
moment. Anyway, the code is entirely unoptimized at this stage.
